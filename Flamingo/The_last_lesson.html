What was Franz expected to be prepared with for school that day?

That day, Franz was expected to be prepared with the lesson on participles.

What did Franz notice that was unusual about the school that day?

</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
That day, Franz noticed the absence of the routine commotion caused by the opening 
and closing of desks, repeating of lessons in unison and rapping of the teacher's ruler 
on the table. The usual hustle-bustle was replaced by a strange stillness that was the 
characteristic of a school on a "Sunday morning."

What had been put up on the bulletin-board?

</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
The bulletin-board notified the general public about an order from Berlin. It stated that 
only German was to be taught to students in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine.

What changes did the order from Berlin cause in school that day?

</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
The order from Berlin brought all the routine hustle-bustle of the school life to a stand-
still. The teacher, M. Hamel, became more sympathetic to his students and taught his 
lessons with more patience. The students became more attentive in their classes. The 
villagers, who were sitting at the usually empty back benches and had come to show 
their respect and gratitude to M. Hamel, regretted not going to school more than they 
did. The order also brought about a great change in the feelings of the people towards 
their country and their native language. There was a general sadness about not being 
able to utilise the opportunities of learning French when it was easily accessible.

How did Franz's feelings about M. Hamel and school change?

</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
Franz was shocked when M. Hamel told the students about the order from Berlin and 
that it was their last French lesson. He forgot about his teacher's ruler and crankiness. 
He developed a fondness for M. Hamel at the troubling idea of being separated from 
him forever. He understood the pain and agony his teacher was undergoing. And, he
became more sympathetic towards his teacher.
His school too, now, carried a different meaning. His books and lessons seemed old 
friends whom he couldn't give up. He realised with pain how much French meant to him 
and regretted not being attentive in his classes earlier. Suddenly, he felt that the 'difficult 
concepts' had never actually been difficult.

The people in this story suddenly realize how precious their language is to them. 
What shows you this? Why does this happen?

</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
The crowd surrounding the bulletin-board, the presence of the villagers in the class, the 
silence in place of the routine hustle and bustle of the school, the emotions that gripped 
M. Hamel and Franz, representing that of the teacher and the student community 
respectively, were all indicators of the realisation of the importance of their language to
them. 
In the story, M. Hamel says that people realise the importance of somebody or 
something in their lives very often when it is lost to them. Similarly, it was the order from 
Berlin that made people realise the importance of their language for them.

Franz thinks, "Will they make them sing in German, even the pigeons?" What 
could this mean?

</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
Language is inherent to culture and identity. The authority of human beings is restricted 
only to false boundaries that can be controlled. Nature and other things cannot be 
governed by some superficial laws of the wilful people. By taking the reference of 
making the pigeons learn German, the author is pointing to this very constraint. <br>
(or) <br>
This sentence could possibly mean that however hard the authorities try to embed 
German language in the culture of Alsace and Lorraine, the natural status of French, for 
them, will remain unchanged. French flows in the air and the entire place is imbued with 
its effect. Even though they train students in German, the basic mode of communication 
would remain unchanged like the cooing of the pigeons.

Write a paragraph of about 100 words arguing for or against having to study three 
languages at school.

</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
For<br>
Knowledge of additional language gives an edge - makes a person more competitive in 
today's fast paced world - better employment opportunities with fluency in a foreign 
language - multi-national companies send professionals for on-site projects to other 
countries - delegates from other countries coming to interact with people of our country - 
can work as translators, interpreters or tourist guides, etc. - preservation of culture and 
tradition through native language. <br>
Against<br>
Students are already burdened with two languages - no need for a third language - no 
natural inclination for foreign language - foreign language not of much use in daily life 
and gradually gets forgotten - should not be forced on people who do not need it - can 
be taught only to those who demand for it - time and effort should not be wasted on 
something of no clear use. <br>

Have you ever changed your opinion about someone or something that you had 
earlier liked or disliked? Narrate what led you to change your mind.

</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
Directions:<br>Think about something that you hated earlier but hate no more. It may be 
anything - eating a particular vegetable, studying a subject, going to a particular place. 
Or, you may think about a person whom you did not like earlier but your opinion about 
that person has changed now. It might be because of some misunderstanding or so. <br>
After you make your choice, recollect the reason for your dislike. Recollect what 
happened that made you change your opinion about the thing or person. Think about 
how it helped you look at things or events or people in different perspective. Write about 
it in a paragraph form. You may end it by talking about the learning experience or how it 
enriched your perspective or broadened your scope of thinking. <br>

</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
When M.Hamel was giving his last French ; lesson, the mood in the classroom was solemn and sombre. When he announced that this was their last French lesson everyone present in the classroom suddenly developed patriotic feelings for their native language and genuinely regretted ignoring their mother tongue.

What had the narrator counted on to enter the school, unnoticed? 
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
The narrator (Franz) had counted on the hustle and bustle that was usual when the school began in order to enter there unnoticed. He had thought he could depend on the commotion to get to his desk without anybody noticing that he was late for the class.

“This is your last French lesson.” How did Franz react to this declaration of M.Hamel? 
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
When M.Hamel declared that it was their last French lesson a grim realisation dawned on Franz that he had so much more yet to learn. He felt sorry for whiling away his time and skipping his lessons. Now he did not want to part with his books, which he had earlier consi¬dered a nuisance. He was also deeply pained at the thought that M.Hamel was leaving.

“What a thunder clap these words were to me!” Which were the words that shocked and surprised little Franz? 

</h3>

When M.Hamel mounted on the chair and announced that he was there to teach his last French lesson that day, Franz was shocked and surprised. He felt very guilty for deliberately ignoring to learn his native language and he suddenly developed a strange fascination for his language and his school.

When M.Hamel announced that this was to be their last French class a grim realisation dawned on Franz that he could hardly write his language and now he was being deprived of the opportunity to learn it. He felt very guilty of neglecting his classes and escaping school. The thought of losing his teacher, M. Hamel, also pained him.

What was tempting Franz to keep away from school That morning’? 
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
Franz was very late for school ‘that morning’. M. Hamel was to question the students on participles and Franz knew nothing and feared a scolding. The bright weather, woods, fields and chirping of birds tempted him to spend the day outdoors.

</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
To bid farewell to his students and the people of the town M.Hamel wore his formal suit on the day he gave his last French lesson. He assumed the role of a mentor and advised the villagers to safeguard their language, which was the most beautiful and logical language in the world. Being rimmed up with emotions, he wrote “Vive La France” which mean Tong live France’ in order to inculcate a feeling of patriotism within everyone.

Who did M.Hamel blame for the neglect of learning on the part of boys like Franz?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
Mr. Hamel blamed various people for different reasons for neglect of learning on the part of boys like Franz. First he blamed the parents for not being anxious to have their children learn and rather engaging them into household work. He blamed the boys themselves for preferring to work on mills and farms. He also blamed himself for sending boys on errands for his convenience.

What was Franz expected to be prepared with for the school that day?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
Franz had started very late for school that morning. He feared facing his class-teacher, M. Hamel. Because he was expected to be prepared with his grammar lesson on participles and he did not know even the first word about them. So he feared a scolding.

What was unusual about M. Hamel’s dress and behaviour on the day of his last French lesson? officers.

</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
On the day of his last French lesson M. Hamel was unexpectantly kind. He had put on his beautiful green coat, frilled shirt and an embroidered black silk cap that he normally wore only on inspection and prize days. In his last lesson he explains everything with unusual patience as if he wants to teach them everything he has ever learned in their last French class.
