What is the "misadventure" that William Douglas speaks about?

</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
Douglas refers to the incident at the Y.M.C.A. swimming pool where he almost drowned 
as a "misadventure." The author was about ten or eleven years old at the time and had 
barely begun to learn swimming, primarily by aping others. As he was thrown suddenly 
into the water by someone and he couldn't swim, he started drowning. The struggle to 
come to surface and to avoid getting drowned left him with a deep fear of water which 
deprived him from enjoying water-related activities for many years.

What were the series of emotions and fears that Douglas experienced when he 
was thrown into the pool? What plans did he make to come to the surface?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
The sudden realization of being thrown into the pool did not make him lose his wits 
immediately. Although frightened, he thought of a trick to come up to the surface but 
couldn't execute it successfully. He panicked and felt suffocated by the water. His 
sense-perceptions gave way, his heart pounded loudly, his limbs became paralyzed 
with fear, his mind became dizzy and his lungs ached as he gulped water while making 
desperate attempts to come out of the water. Finally, he lost all his strength and
willingness to keep struggling and blacked out.<br>
Douglas planned to allow himself to go down till his feet hit the bottom so that could 
make a big jump to come back to the surface like a cork. Then, he would lie flat on the 
surface of water and paddle to the edge of the pool.

How did this experience affect him?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           

The near death experience of drowning had a very strong impact on his psychology. He 
was deeply perturbed and shaken by the whole experience. A haunting fear of water 
took control of his physical strength and emotional balance for many years. As he 
couldn't bear being surrounded by water, he was deprived of enjoying any water-related 
activity.

How does Douglas make clear to the reader the sense of panic that gripped him 
as he almost drowned? Describe the details that have made the description vivid. 
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
Douglas takes us through his near death experience at the Y.M.C.A. pool by detailing 
every little aspect associated to it. He details minutes of his emotional, mental and physical struggle with the paralyzing fear of being drowned in the water. The first person 
narration of the incident also helps us to associate with his experience more deeply. <br>
Though he did not lose his wits initially, he panicked when his strategy didn't work. His 
feeling of suffocation, fear and losing hold on sense perceptions make the readers 
experience what he does. His eyes couldn't see beyond the dirty yellow water. His voice 
did not assist him. His nose and mouth could only manage to take water to the 
lungs. His limbs became paralyzed with fear and his mind dizzy. His desperation to 
save himself kept him struggling until he went down the third time and blacked out. All 
these details make the description vivid.

Why was Douglas determined to get over his fear of water?

</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           

Douglas regretted being deprived of enjoying water activities like canoeing, boating, 
swimming, fishing, etc. The wish to enjoy them and the craving to regain his lost 
confidence, while being in water, made him try every possible way to get rid of his fear. 
He was finally able to overcome this mental handicap by getting himself a swimming 
instructor and further ensuring that no residual fear was left.

How did Douglas overcome his fear of water? 

</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
At first, he tried to overcome his fear of water on his own. But when this failed, he got 
an instructor for himself who worked on Douglas' fear very methodically. With his help, 
Douglas began by learning to be at ease in water. After this, he practiced exhaling-
inhaling in water to eliminate the fear of putting his head inside the water. Then, he 
moved on to master individual steps of swimming which were, finally, integrated into a 
complete experience of swimming, by his instructor. After about six months, Douglas 
could not only swim well but was, also, free of his fear to a great extent. 
At this stage, Douglas' journey of truly overcoming his fear to its tiniest vestiges began. 
He swam alone in the pool. He went to Lake Wentworth to dive. He tried every possible
stroke he learnt. Finally, in his diving expedition, in the Warm Lake, he conquered his 
fear completely.

How did the instructor "build a swimmer" out of Douglas?

</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
The instructor worked gradually on Douglas' psychology, moved on to his physical 
movements and then integrated each part to build a swimmer out of him. 
Initially, he made Douglas swim back and forth across the swimming pool so that he 
could get used to it. He used an elaborate mechanism with a rope, belt, pulley and an 
overhead cable to help them stay connected while Douglas was in the pool. Then, one-
by-one, he made Douglas master the individual techniques of swimming, like putting his 
head in the water, exhaling and inhaling while in water, movements of his hands, body, 
legs, etc. Finally, he integrated these perfected steps into a whole experience of 
swimming for Douglas.

Why does Douglas as an adult recount a childhood experience of terror and his 
conquering of it? What larger meaning does he draw from his experience?

</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
Douglas recounts his childhood experience at the Y.M.C.A. pool to enable the readers 
to understand the exact nature and intensity of the terror. The fear of being surrounded 
by the water, the fear of putting his head in the water, the fear of choking and the fear of 
his limbs going numb couldn't have been explained to a reader unacquainted with 
Douglas' childhood experience. In that case, the elaborate strategy adopted by the 
author (and his instructor) and the time-taken by him to learn or master even simple 
things, though put in the perspective of his fear of water, couldn't have been understood 
properly. 
By quoting Roosevelt, "All we have to fear is fear itself," Douglas indicates the larger 
meaning that he draws from his experience. For him, the importance of life became

How did Douglas make sure that he conquered the old terror?


</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">

Even after the swimming training was over, Douglas wasn't confident about his 
swimming or that he had overcome the fear. He was determined to completely get rid of 
it forever. He swam alone in the pool. He went to Lake Wentworth to dive. There, he 
tried every possible stroke he had learnt. He fought back the tiny vestiges of terror that gripped him in middle of the lake. Finally, in his diving expedition in the Warm Lake, he 
realised that he had truly conquered his old terror.

If someone else had narrated Douglas' experience, how would it have differed 
from this account? Write out a sample paragraph or paragraphs from this text 
from the point of view of a third person or observer to find out which style of 
narration would you consider to be more effective? Why?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           

If a third person had narrated Douglas' experience, the impact of the story would have 
lost the reader's deep connection with the main protagonist and his fear of water. The 
narrator then would be passively telling the story from the perspective of an observer. 
The incident of drowning in water could never have successfully communicated the 
feeling of the "stark terror" that Douglas underwent. 
In third person narrative, the 8th and 9th paragraph of the story would be as follows:
"He flailed at the surface of the water, swallowed and choked. He tried to bring his legs 
up but they hung as dead weights, paralyzed and rigid. A great force was pulling him 
under. He screamed, but only the water heard him. He had started on the long journey 
back to the bottom of the pool."
"He struck at the water as he went down; expending his strength as one in a nightmare, 
fights an irresistible force. He had lost all his breath. His lungs ached. His head 
throbbed. He was getting dizzy. But he remembered the strategy - he would spring from 
the bottom of the pool and come like a cork to the surface. He would lie flat on the 
water, strike out with his arms, and thrash with his legs. Then he would get to the edge
of the pool and be safe."
So, it is only the first person narrative that keeps the reader gripped to the story. It 
makes the experience more relevant and tangible for the reader. It engages him by 
making him go through the experience along with the protagonist. The desperation and 
helplessness of being in water, which has almost become fatal, the mental and physical 
agony of trying to survive the crisis, the long struggle of overcoming the fear bit-by-bit 
and the jubilation of conquering it at the end; all make the reader feel part of the 
experience. The first person narrative makes the story a fast-paced and urgent reading 
for the readers. All this would have been lost had it been a third person narrative or from 
the point of view of an observer.

"All we have to fear is fear itself". Have you ever had a fear that you have now 
overcome? Share your experience with your partner.
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           

Directions: Everyone has some or other fear that has been overcome. Think about one 
such experience from your life. It may be anything associated to activities that you now 
engage in with ease but were scared earlier. Driving, skating, public-speaking, 
participating in a competition or overcoming stage fear are some examples. <br>
After you have found one such example from your life, recollect the reason it bothered 
or frightened you. Recollect the efforts you and/or other people put in to help you get rid 
of it. Discuss the detailed experience with your partner in the class. Also, discuss your 
feelings when you realised that you have overcome the fear entirely. <br>

Doing well in any activity, for example a sport, music, dance or painting, riding a 
motorcycle or a car, involves a great deal of struggle. Most of us are very nervous 
to begin with until gradually we overcome our fears and perform well. <br>
Write an essay of about five paragraphs recounting such an experience. Try to 
recollect minute details of what caused the fear, your feelings, the 
encouragement you got from others or the criticism. <br>
You could begin with the last sentence of the essay you have just read - "At last I 
felt released - free to walk the trails and climb the peaks and to brush aside fear."

Directions: You may follow the given steps for the essay:<br>
Paragraph 1: Begin with "At last I felt released - free to walk the trails and climb the 
peaks and to brush aside fear. Fear, when conquered, becomes victory. And a victory, 
emerging from the bitterness of failures and hardships of enduring them for a long 
period of time, has its own meaning and charm. When I look back, it appears to be a 
long and arduous journey that has now successfully culminated in its destination." <br>
Paragraph 2: Talk about the beginning of the incident that was the root cause for your 
fear. Try to pen down what you saw, what you felt and what you thought. Recollect and 
write the details of the surrounding environment, people and things.<br>
Paragraph 3: Here, you can continue talking about how the incident progressed in terms
of the subsequent events or happenings. Detail the exact proceedings in the logical 
order of their happening. You may talk about what you think went wrong and how the
incident could have ended differently. <br>
Paragraph 4: In this paragraph, you may write how the fear proved a handicap or how it 
affected other activities of your life. And then write about when you decided that you will 
get rid of it. Talk about your plans, strategies and things that you may have considered 
to ensure that you succeed in your attempt. <br>
Paragraph 5: In the last paragraph, you can detail all your efforts (and that of others) 
and end with an analysis of why you won over your fear.<br>

Find and narrate other stories about conquest of fear and what people have said 
about courage. For example, you can recall Nelson Mandela's struggle for 
freedom, his perseverance to achieve his mission, to liberate the oppressed and 
the oppressor as depicted in his autobiography. The story We're Not Afraid to 
Die, which you have read in Class IX, is an apt example of how courage and 
optimism helped a family survive under the direst stress.

Dear Garima, <br>
I hope this letter finds you in good health and spirits. I've something interesting to share
this time. I have learnt skating, this summer. Being able to skate is a wonderful feeling
and it fills me with loads of confidence. There is an odd sense of power in knowing that 
every technique and skill required to master has been learnt. With a little more practice, 
I would feel my spirits flying high. <br>
Initially, I was very scared of even wearing my skates. But all the bruises, injuries, 
frustrations and pessimistic ideas that gripped me during some of the initial training 
sessions now seem nothing in front of what I feel. It gives me immense satisfaction to 
see myself almost flying in the air. Skating also helps me stay fit. Even my parents are 
happy to see me investing my time constructively.<br> 
Do let me know about your hobby classes. Convey my kind regards to uncle and aunt. <br>
Yours affectionately, <br>
Nishtha <br>
