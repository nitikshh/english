           Why is Rajkumar Shukla described as being ‘resolute’?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Rajkumar Shukla is described as being ‘resolute’ because even after being told 
about the prior engagements of Gandhi at Cawnpore and other parts across the 
county, he does not quit. He continues to accompany Gandhi everywhere. 
Furthermore, he persistently asks Gandhi to fix a date for his visit to his native 
district of Champaran. His resolution and determination

           Why do you think the servants thought Gandhi to be another peasant?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Gandhi was a simple and humble man dressed in a plain ‘dhoti’ (loincloth). To the 
servants, he must have looked like just another poor farmer in this country. 
Moreover, he was accompanied by Rajkumar Shukla whom they knew to be a poor 
indigo sharecropper. Thus, when the servants saw them both together, they mistook 
Gandhi to be another peasant.

           List the places that Gandhi visited between his first meeting with Shukla and his 
arrival at Champaran.
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           After his first meeting with Shukla, Gandhi visited Cawnpore, his ashram near 
Ahmedabad, Calcutta, Patna and Muzzafarpur before he reached Champaran.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           What did the peasants pay the British landlords as rent? What did the British now 
want instead and why? What would be the impact of synthetic indigo on the prices 
of natural indigo?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           According to the long-term contract, the peasants were forced to plant fifteen 
percent of their holdings with indigo and pay the entire harvest as rent.
Now, with the development of synthetic indigo in Germany, the British landlords did 
not want indigo from these plantations. Hence, the shrewd landlords decided to 
release the peasants of Champaran from the fifteen percent arrangement on the 
payment of a compensation.
Development of synthetic indigo would lead to an increase in the price of natural 
indigo.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           The events in this part of the text illustrate Gandhi’s method of working. Can you 
identify some instances of this method and link them to his ideas of satyagraha and 
non-violence?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           There are many instances in the narrative that can be linked to Gandhi’s idea of 
non-cooperation and satyagraha. One such instance is Gandhi’s refusal to obey the 
court order asking him to leave Champaran immediately. Besides that, Gandhi’s 
protest against the delay of the court proceedings is also an instance of his belief in 
civil disobedience.
Furthermore, Gandhi does not falter to plead guilty in front of the court. He accepts 
his guilt but presents a rational case as to what made him disobey the law. For him, 
truth is above everything and, thus, he decides to follow the voice of conscience 
and obey the “higher law of our being”.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           Why did Gandhi agree to a settlement of 25 per cent refund to the farmers?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           For Gandhi, it was not the money but the principles that were of utmost importance. 
He believed that the very fact that the British landlords surrendered was of more 
significance than the percentage of refund. He wanted the poor farmers to realise 
that they too had rights and that they need not really live in fear of the British 
landlords. Therefore, although he had initially quoted a 50 percent refund, he later 
agreed to a settlement of 25 percent refund to the farmers. Besides, Gandhi was 
interested in long-term solutions rather than immediate benefits. His decision was 
proved right when, years later, the British landlords decided to leave their estates, 
 putting an end to the sharecropping arrangement.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           How did the episode change the plight of the peasants?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           The episode of Champaran brought more than one change in the plight of the 
peasants of that district. These peasants gained confidence which was evident in 
their spontaneous demonstration on the morning of Gandhi’s trial. After the 
successful refund of the compensation, the peasants, for the first time, realised 
their own rights and were liberated from the fear that had plagued them.
This episode brought an end to the fifteen percent arrangement of sharecropping. 
However, the most radical change that the episode brought about was in their 
social and cultural standard. Gandhi opened schools in six villages. His wife took 
pains to make the peasants aware of the importance of general sanitation and 
personal hygiene. He even appointed a doctor.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           Why do you think Gandhi considered the Champaran episode to be a turning-point 
in his life?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Gandhi considered the Champaran episode to be a turning point in his life because 
he realised that civil disobedience, which had triumphed for the first time, could go 
a long way in the freedom struggle. Moreover, he had succeeded in making the 
peasants aware of their rights and becoming confident. This success, thus, proved 
the effectiveness of Gandhi’s method of non-violence and non-cooperation.

           How was Gandhi able to influence lawyers? Give instances.
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Gandhi was able to influence the lawyers through his conviction, earnestness and 
pertinent questioning. Gandhi reproached the lawyers of Muzzafarpur for charging 
a large sum of money as fee from the peasants. Later, the lawyers from Bihar 
opined that they would return to their own places in the event of his imprisonment. 
But, Gandhi made them realise that it would be impudent for them, being lawyers 
from a neighbouring place, to return when a stranger was ready to get himself 
imprisoned for the peasants. So, they agreed to follow him to jail. Gandhi also 
convinced the lawyers not to seek support from an Englishman and be self-reliant.

           What was the attitude of the average Indian in smaller localities towards advocates 
of ‘home rule’?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           During those times, the average Indian in smaller localities lived in fear of the 
British. They were afraid of the dire consequences of helping the advocates of 
“home-rule”. Hence, though they were supportive of people like Gandhi, they were 
afraid of showing it explicitly and only a few could actually dare to come out openly. 
In the story, we find people, like Professor Malkani, who had the courage to give 
shelter to Gandhi on the latter’s visit to Muzzafarpur.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           How do we know that ordinary people too contributed to the freedom movement?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           In the chapter ‘Indigo’ Louis Fischer writes of how a small farmer Rajkumar Shukla 
from a small district, Champaran, helps bring about a very prominent change. 
Likewise, many other peasants from the villages fought courageously and 
contributed in their own way to the movement. Their cumulative effort eventually 
resulted in their winning the battle of Champaran and to finally free themselves of 
the sharecropping arrangement.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           How did Rajkumar Shukla establish that he was resolute?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Rajkumar Shukla was a peasant from Champaran. He wanted Gandhiji to come with him to accompany him to Champaran. At that time Gandhiji was very busy. But Shukla accompanied Gandhiji everywhere. Therefore, he had been described as resolute.

           How was Gandhiji treated at Rajendra Prasad’s house?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
The servants at Rajendra Prasad knew Shukla as a peasant who pestered their master to help the indigo sharecroppers. But they thought that Gandhiji belonged to some low caste. Therefore they didn’t allow him to draw water from the well.

           What were the terms of the indigo contract between the British landlords and the Indian peasants?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
The landlords compelled all tenahts to plant three twentieths or 15 per cent of their holdings with indigo and surrender the entire indigo harvest as rent. This was done by a long-term contract.

           What did the landlords do when they know that Germany had developed synthetic indigo?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
The landlords came to know that Germany had developed synthetic indigo. Now producing natural indigo was not profitable for them. But very cunningly they hid that fact from the peasants. They instead obtained agreements from the sharecroppers to pay ‘ them compensation for being released from the 15 per cent arrangement.

      <div class="faq-answer">
           
Gandhiji arrived Chamaparan to get the facts. Therefore he visited the Secretary of the British landlord’s association. The secretary told him that they could give no information to an outsider.

           Why did Gandhiji chide the lawyers of Muzza-farpur?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
Gandhiji chided the lawyers for collecting big fee from the peasants. He said that he had come to the conclusion that they should stop going to courts. Taking such cases to the courts did little good. Where the peasants were so crushed and fear-stricken, law courts were useless. The real relief for them was to be free from fear.

The news of Gandhiji’s advent and of the nature of his mission spread quickly through Muzzafarpur and to Champaran. Sharecroppers from Champaran began arriving on foot and by conveyance to see their champion.

When the Champaran peasants came to know that a Mahatma had come to help them and he was in trouble with the authorities they came in large numbers to Motihari. Thousands of them hold demon¬strations around the courthouse. The officials felt themselves helpless.

</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
Thousands of peasants came in support of Gandhiji. The authorities felt that they could not control them and the condition of law and order could deteriorate. The pressure of the peasants was increasing. On the other hand, Gandhiji refuse to have any bail. Therefore the lieutenant-general dropped the case against Gandhiji.
