           What does the writer mean by ‘the fiery misery’ of those subjected to make-up’?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           The make-up room of Gemini Studios looked like a hair cutting salon. It had around half
a dozen mirrors with incandescent lights at all angles around them. The artists would
feel the heat emanating from these lights. Thus, the writer uses the term ‘fiery misery’ to
denote the uncomfortable situation of those subjected to make-up.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           What is the example of national integration that the author refers to?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           The make-up division of the Gemini Studios was an example of national integration.
According to the author, this is so because people from different regions and religious
groups worked together in the same department. The department was headed by a
Bengali who was succeeded by a Maharashtrian. The other helpers included a Dharwar
Kannadiga, an Andhra, a Madras Indian Christian, an Anglo-Burmese and the local
Tamils.

           What work did the ‘office boy’ do i
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           The ‘office boy’ was responsible for the make-up of the people who formed part of crowd
in the films. He used to mix his paint in a giant vessel and slapped the paint on the faces
of the players.
He had joined the Gemini Studios years ago, aspiring to become an actor, or a
scriptwriter, or a director, or a lyricist. He was disappointed with the studio that failed to
recognise his talent. He called it a “department fit only for barbers and perverts”.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           Why did the author appear to be doing nothing at the studios?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           The job of the author was to cut newspaper clippings and file them. For the other
employees, all he seemed to be doing is tearing newspapers, which according to them
did not qualify as work.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           Why was the office boy frustrated? Who did he show his anger on?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           The office boy had joined the studio years ago in the hope of becoming an actor or a
screenwriter, or a director, or a lyricist. The fact that he ended up becoming none of
these left him frustrated. According to him, “great literary talent was being allowed to go
waste in a department fit only for barbers and perverts”. He used to direct his anger at
the author even though it was meant for Kothamangalam Subbu.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           Why was the legal adviser referred to as the opposite by others?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           A lawyer used to be a part of the story department at the Gemini studios. Though, a legal
adviser was supposed to be involved in legal matters, his cagey yet stupid idea led to the
end of an actress’s career. Due to this, he was referred to as the opposite of a legal
advisor, by the people.

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-question">
           What made the lawyer stand out from the others at Gemini Studios?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           The lawyer wore pants and a tie and sometimes a coat whereas everyone else in the
Story Department wore similar khadi dhoti with a slightly oversized and clumsily tailored
white khadi shirt. Thus, the lawyer stood out from others at Gemini Studios as if he is a
dispassionate man who did not take sides. Moreover, he was a logical man with no
emotional attachment whatsoever.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           Did the people at Gemini Studios have any particular political affiliations?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           The people at Gemini Studios did not have any particular political affiliations. The
common political notions of the day managed to influence them but that was limited to
wearing khadi and admiring the Gandhian philosophy. They were averse to the term
‘Communism’ but had only an erroneous understanding of the concept.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           Why was the Moral Re-Armament army welcomed at the studio?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Frank Buchman’s Moral Re-Armament army was welcomed at the studio mainly because
of their political association. The people at the Gemini Studios were averse to
Communism, and hence, were ready to play host to the MRA.
Apart from that, the studio people hardly had any occupation and suffered from
boredom. The MRA came as a welcome change to their monotonous days at the studio.
      </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-question">
           Name one example to show that Gemini Studios was influenced by the plays staged by
MRA.
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Madras and Tamil drama community included scenes of ‘sunset and sunrise in the
manner of Jotham Valley’ in almost all of their plays. This shows how the plays, staged
by MRA, influenced Gemini Studios.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           What caused the lack of communication between the Englishman and the people at
Gemini Studios?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           The accent of Stephen Spender, the Englishman, was the main cause of the lack of
communication between him and the people at Gemini Studios. Apart from that, the
people did not have any idea about what he was talking.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-question">
           Why is the Englishman’s visit referred to as unexplained mystery?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           The Englishman’s visit to the Gemini Studios is referred to as an unexplained mystery
because no one could decipher his identity, whether he was a poet or an editor. Besides,
when he spoke no one at the studio understood what he intended to say as his accent
was beyond their comprehension.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-question">
           Who was the English visitor to the studio?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           The English visitor to the Gemini Studios was Stephen Spender. He was the editor of The
Encounter, a British Periodical, and a famous English poet, essayist and novelist of the
twentieth century.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-question">
           How did the author discover who the English visitor to the studios was?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Before investing money in participating in a short story contest organised by an English
periodical The Encounter, the author did a research on the magazine. He went to the
British Council Library where, while going through an issue of that periodical, he
discovered that its editor was Stephen Spender, the poet that had once visited the
studio.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-question">
           Why was Kothamangalam Subbu considered No. 2 in Gemini Studios?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Kothamangalam Subbu succeeded in securing the place closest to The Boss by means
of flattery. He was not brilliant but a rather cheerful person and exceedingly loyal to The
Boss. He offered solutions whenever The Boss was in a fix. Thus, the other employees
considered him No.2 in Gemini Studios.
      </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-question">
           How does the author describe the incongruity of an English poet addressing the
audience at Gemini Studios?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           The audience at the Gemini studios was not knowledgeable enough to understand the
thrills and travails of an English poet, of which the visitor poet-editor talked about, in his
speech. The studio made films for simple people whose limited resources did not
provide them with an opportunity to develop a taste in English poetry. The audience
failed to understand anything the poet said, all the more, because of the latter’s accent.
The poet-editor, in turn, looked baffled realising the utter inappropriateness of his speech
being directed to such an audience.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-question">
           What do you understand about the author’s literary inclinations from the account?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Though the author had a very tedious and unchallenging job at the studios, his interest in
literature and writing is apparent in his willingness to participate in the short story
contest organised by the British periodical, The Encounter. Moreover, the author appears
to be a keen reader visiting libraries and buying books on wide-ranging topics whenever
he could afford them. Besides, the narrative also establishes the fact that the author was
one of the most knowledgeable persons in Gemini Studios. His idea about how prose
writing was not meant for geniuses but for those with patience and perseverance,
highlight his reflective and deep thoughts on literature and creative writing.
