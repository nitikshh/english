What explanations does the author offer for the children not wearing footwear?

</h3>

The author comes across many shoeless rag-picker children in her neighbourhood. 
According to her, one explanation of this habit of remaining barefoot is that it is a 
tradition among the poor children of this country. However, the author quickly mentions 
that calling it a tradition could be just a means of justification of the utter destitution.mbarrassed.

What could be some of the reasons for the migration of people from villages to 
cities? 

</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           

There are many factors that cause migration of people from villages to cities. Some
villagers voluntarily move to the cities in search for jobs and better civic and health
facilities, etc. Others are forced to migrate when natural disasters like flood, storm, 
drought, famine, etc. destroy their houses and properties. History has records of large 
scale migrations caused by wars. Also, many villagers who are better off than others 
manage to send their children to study in the cities. 
In the lesson 'Lost Spring', Saheb and his family migrates to Seemapuri from Dhaka 
after their houses were destroyed in the storms.

How, in your opinion, can Mukesh realise his dream? 
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
Mukesh was different from the others of his community. By daring to dream, he has 
already taken the first step towards a big change. He wants to become a motor 
mechanic and drive a car. He can realise this dream with determination and hard work. 
There might be many obstacles on his way but a strong willpower will help him move 
towards the way to success. The fact that he is willing to walk a long distance in order to 
learn the vocation, underlines his firm resolve. The only thing left for him to do is to 
make that first journey to that garage and request the owner to take him in and guide 
and direct him on his journey as a mechanic.

Would you agree that promises made to poor children are rarely kept? Why do 
you think this happens in the incidents narrated in the text? 

</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
Yes, the promises made to poor children are seldom kept. Often, they are not taken
seriously or have been made on the pretext of retaining a child's fancy for something. 
This keeps the child hoping for a better possibility till he/she realises the truth. It is 
difficult for people to shatter the children's dreams; while it is also painful to see these
children thrive of false hopes given to them. 
Once, while interacting with Saheb, the narrator ends up encouraging him to study and 
jokingly talks about opening a school herself. At that time she fails to realise that 
unknowingly she has sown a seed of hope in Saheb's heart. She becomes conscious of 
her mistake when, after a few days, Saheb approaches her, enquiring about her school. 
Her hollow promise leaves her embarrassed.

Mention the hazards of working in the glass bangles industry. 

</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
The impoverished workers in the glass bangles industry toil in potentially hazardous 
working conditions while welding. The furnaces they work in have extremely high 
temperature and lack proper ventilation. Persistently working in low light conditions, 
without any protective eye gear, leaves them blind. Even burns and cuts are quite 
common. The workers are quite prone to ailments such as lung cancer.

Why should child labour be eliminated and how? 
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           

Child labour should be eliminated because it takes away from the child his childhood 
and the prospect of elementary education. Moreover, since the child labourers are 
cheap, and consequently engaged in hazardous and dangerous employment, they are 
often vulnerable to mental and physical illness. In order to curb this problem, it is 
important to make education easily accessible. Apart from that, the parents must be 
made aware of the consequences of working in harmful environments. It is also 
important to make the public aware of the fact that child labour is a criminal offence and 
is punishable under law. The government must ensure stricter child labour laws and that 
the offenders are punished.

How is Mukesh's attitude to his situation different from that of his family?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           

Mukesh belongs to a family of glass bangle makers in Firozabad. Even though the 
children of such families usually carry on their family profession, Mukesh wants to be a 
motor mechanic and drive a car. Unlike his family members, and others of his 
community, he has dared to dream. His grandmother's words about the unbreakable 
lineage represent the attitude they have towards their situation in life. They believe that 
it is their destiny to toil as bangle makers. But Mukesh dreams of a better and safer 
career. The resolute boy is willing to walk a long distance from his home to learn to be a 
mechanic, exemplifying the saying, 'where there is a will, there is a way'.

What does the writer mean when she says, ‘Saheb is no longer his own master’? (Delhi 2000)
Answer:
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
Since Saheb now works in a tea-stall, he is now bound to his master and feels burdened. The steel canister he carries is very heavy as compared to his light plastic bag. The bag was his own and the canister belongs to his master whose orders he now has to follow. So he is no longer his own master.

Mukesh’s determination is going to prove instrumental in helping him to realize his dream. His dream can become a reality only if he is able to find a garage where he can be taken in as an apprentice and then he will have to learn how to drive a car. He will then be able to graduate himself to be a good mechanic.

What does the title, ‘Lost Spring’ convey? (All India 2000)
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           
The title ‘Lost Spring’ conveys how millions of children in India lose out on living the ‘spring’ of their lives, that is their childhood. The best phase of life is lost in the hardships involved to earn their livelihood. Poverty forces these young children to work in the most inhuman conditions as a result of which they miss out on the fun of childhood which hampers their growth.

For the children garbage has a different meaning from what it means for the adults. For the children it is wrapped in wonder, their eyes light-up when they find a rupee or a ten-rupee note in it. They search the garbage excitedly with the hope of finding something more. But for the elders it is a means of survival.
