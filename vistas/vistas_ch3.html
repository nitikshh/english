           How do geological phenomena help us to know about the history of 
humankind?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
          The geological phenomenon of separating various continents and water 
bodies from one compact landmass tells us about the age of existence of 
human race on the earth. Six hundred and fifty million years ago, no 
human race existed on the earth because the environment was not 
favourable. After the time when the dinosaurs were wiped out, the 
Mammals started existing and after the separation of

           What are the indications for the future of humankind?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           The future of the humankind can get in danger if the emission of carbon-
dioxide and other poisonous gases go on in the same manner. These 
gases deplete the ozone layer and allow the ultra-violet rays of the sun 
to enter the earth’s environment. This causes the rise in temperature of 
the earth and giving rise to the phenomenon called global warming. 
Increased temperature can melt the ice of the Antarctica, and cause 
other environmental problems, thus jeopardizing the future of human 
kind.

           ‘The world’s geological history is trapped in Antarctica.’ How is the 
study of this region useful to us?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           The study of this region of Antarctica gives us insight into the world’s 
geological history. It gives an idea, how the earth was like, before it 
drifted into continents and countries. It shows how slight changes in the 
climate can change the shape of the region. It gives the explanation how 
the climatic conditions of the earth were not favourable for life before 
and how slowly rising temperature made earth a place to sustain life. All 
secrets are embedded in the layers of ice in the form of half million year 
old carbon records.

           What are Geoff Green’s reasons for including high school students in 
the Students on Ice expedition?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Geoff Green took the high school students to one end of the world, to 
provide them the opportunity to develop the respect and understanding 
for the earth. He wanted to make the future policy-makers to 
experience how difficult it would have been for the earth to sustain life 
by rising its temperature. He wanted them to understand that any 
interference in nature can cause drastic mishappenings in the future 
when the students see the ice shelves melting and collapsing, they can 
estimate the kind of environmental troubles ahead in their future.

           ‘Take care of the small things and the big things will take care of 
themselves.’ What is the relevance of this statement in the context of 
the Antarctic environment?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           This statement has great relevance in the context of the Antarctic 
environment. A small change in the environment can give rise to drastic 
developments. Antarctica has a small biodiversity. The example of small 
grass called phytoplankton can be studied in this context. These 
microscopic grasses undergo the process of photosynthesis and serve as 
food for number of marine birds and animals. The author says if there is 
further depletion of the ozone layer, it will affect the phytoplanktons 
and the carbon cycle on the globe. This whole process can jeopardize 
the existence of all the marine birds and animals. So if we take care that processes carried over by these small grasses are carried out properly, 
the bigger animals and birds will fall into the place on their own.

           Why is Antarctica the place to go to, to understand the earth’s 
present, past and future?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Antarctica gives us an idea, how the earth would have been like millions 
of years ago and how it got divided into various earth masses. The 
melting and colliding ice masses also give us an insight into how our 
future is going to be, if we continue with interference in the working of 
the nature. Moreover, Antarctica holds into the depths of its ice half-
million year old carbon records, which are helpful in understanding the 
past, present and future of the earth. Therefore, Antarctica is the place 
which reveals our past, shows our present and visualizes our future.
