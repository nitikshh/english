           Who is Jo? How does she respond to her father’s story telling?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
          Jo is the shortened form of Joanne. She is the four year old daughter of 
Jack and Clare. For the last two years, her father, Jack, has been telling 
her bed-time stories. Since these stories are woven around the same 
basic tale and have the same characters and turn of events,
She was an intelligent and inquisitive child. Her mind was bubbling with 
queries regarding whatever she heard or saw. Her responses to the 
stories were a curious mixture of emotions caught in recognition of the 
known and eagerness to explore the unknown aspects woven in the 
basic tale by her father. An impatient Jo wanted the story to move with 
a fast pace and yet cannot proceed with conflicting ideas or unresolved
queries in her mind. She was also a very observant listener and 
corrected her father wherever she felt he faltered. The intensity of her 
engagement with the story was apparent from her body language and 
facial expressions. She empathized with the protagonist and rejected 
whatever did not fit in her own narrow world. The eagerness to 
understand and the restlessness to assert her point of view kept her 
awake. She was even willing to fight with her father and to coax him to 
end the story according to her standpoint. Her responses indicate that 
she had started developing a personality of her own.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           What possible plot line could the story continue with?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           From the perspective of Jo, the story should have ended with a happy 
note of Roger Skunk getting rid of the foul smell forever and being able 
to play with all other children. However, from the perspective of Jack, 
the story may not have such an innocent fairy tale ending. In the process 
of story telling, it was evident that Jack got nostalgic about his own 
childhood and his mother. Thus, he brought in his own perspective. His 
sense of belongingness to his mother and his experience of dealing with 
reality resulted in a mature and compromising end where the reality 
limited the scope of fiction. As he associated himself with Roger Skunk of 
his story, he avoided getting into the problematic situation of identity 
crisis and of blaming his mother.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           What do you think was Jo’s problem?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Little Jo had been accustomed to the happy ending of the stories of 
Roger, where the wizard was helpful to him in fulfilling his wish. At the 
request of Roger Skunk, the wizard had changed his awful smell to that 
of the roses. Other small animals liked it and played with Roger Skunk 
happily. She could not digest the ending of the extended story where 
Roger Skunk's mother hit the wizard on the head and forced him to 
change Skunk's smell to the earlier foul one.
Jo could not accept that mother's stubbornness-hitting the well wisher 
of her son, Roger Skunk. Jo insisted that her father should tell her the 
same story again the next day with changed ending. The wizard should 
hit that unreasonable mummy on the head and leave Roger Skunk 
emitting the pleasant smell of roses. In the beautiful world of a child's 
imagination, fairies and wizard's are more real than reality itself. She 
could not digest the harsh realities of life. She did not like the unfeeling 
mother who hit the benefactor of her son.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           What is the moral issue that the story raises?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           The story examines moral issues dependent on different levels of maturity. There is a sharp contrast between an adult’s perspective of life 
and the worldview of a little child. Children represent innocence. Hatred 
and injustice have no place in the their world. In the story, the baby 
skunk was able to make friends only after he smelled of roses. In Jo’s 
perspective, the happiness of being able to make friends surpassed any 
other thing. As a result, she is unable to assess the reason why the 
mother skunk pressurized her child to get his original foul body odour 
restored.
On the contrary, Jack tried to justify the skunk’s mother and wanted 
Roger to listen to his mother even if it means smelling bad again. Jack, a 
typical father, wanted his daughter to believe that parents are always 
correct and they know what is best for their children. Thus, the story 
raises the question of whether parents should always be followed 
blindly.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           How does Jo want the story to end and why?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Jo was not convinced with the ending of the story and coaxed her father 
to retell the story the next day giving the story a predetermined path 
that she had set. According to her, neither Roger Skunk nor the wizard 
was wrong in the story. Jo refused to accept the end where Roger 
Skunk's mother hits the wizard and that too without being hit back. She 
wanted the story to end with the wizard hitting back the mother skunk 
with his magic wand and chopping off her arms 'forcely’.
3. Why does Jack insist that it was the wizard that was hit

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           Why does Jack insist that it was the wizard that was hit and not the 
mother?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Jack has the typical parental attitude. He is of the opinion that the 
parents know what is best for their children. He asserts the parental 
authority tiroe and again to quieten Jo and stifle her objections and 
amendments to the story of the foul smelling Skunk related by him.
He defends the attitude of Roger Skunk's mother. She does not approve 
of the unnatural, unskunk like smell that Roger has. She calls the sweet 
smell of the roses an awful smell. Earlier the little skunk smelled the way 
a little skunk should. She wants the natural characteristic-the foul smell-
restored. He says that she knew what was right. Secondly, the little 
skunk loved his mommy more than he loved all the other animals. That 
is why, he took his mommy to the wizard. She hit the wizard and forced 
him to change the smell of roses to his earlier bad odour. He insisted on 
this ending to emphasise the concern of the parents for children and 
their role in bringing them up on proper lines.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           What makes Jack feel caught in an ugly middle position?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Jack feels that he has been caught in an ugly middle position physically,emotionally as well as mentally. The woodwork, a cage of mouldings and 
rails and skirting boards all around them was half old tan and half new 
ivory.
He was conscious of his duties as a father and as a husband. Little Bobby 
was already asleep. His efforts to make Jo fall asleep proved quite 
fatiguing. She kept on interrupting him, asking for clarifications, pointing 
errors and suggesting alternatives.
Jack did not like that women should take anything for granted. He liked 
them to be apprehensive. So he extended the story, though he was in a 
haste to go down stairs and help his pregnant wife in her hard work of 
painting the woodwork. The result of the extension to the story proved 
unfruitful and unpleasant for Jo, Jack and Clare. Jo wanted him to 
change the ending of the story. Clare complained that he had told a long 
story. Jack felt utter weariness and did not want to speak with his wife or 
work with her or touch her. He was really caught in an ugly middle 
position.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           What is your stance regarding the two endings to the Roger Skunk 
story?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Considering the tender age of Jo, both the endings seem a little 
irrational. It is certain that she will be learning from whatever she hears 
and visualizes at this age. If the story ends according to Jack, Jo will 
never be able to question anything she considers wrong in life since this 
ending stresses that elders are always right in whatever they do. In 
addition, the story shows the skunk’s mommy hitting the wizard for no 
fault of his. The wizard had only done what he was asked to. This may 
scare the four-year-old Jo, as it teaches that mothers, being elders, have 
the right to hit anyone, even if they are not at fault.
On the contrary, if the story ends as Jo wanted it to, it will stop her from 
believing in and respecting her elders. She may even start believing that 
there is nothing wrong in hitting elders.
A balanced view may be given in an apt ending, where the mommy 
either does not hit the wizard at all or realizes her mistake soon.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           Why is the adult’s perspective on life different from that of a child?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           A child’s speech and line of thought, his actions and reactions, are 
natural and not guided by any outward influence. He speaks from his 
heart in accordance with what is ethically right in his perspective. On the 
other hand, an adult has many things to consider before speaking or 
reacting. Thus, the influence of society governs and dominates his thoughts.
In this chapter, Jo speaks what she considers correct. But Jack, an adult 
caught in a dilemma, kept thinking on the consequences of accepting his 
daughter's ending to the story and what the society has made him learn 
over time.
