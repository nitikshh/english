           Who is the Tiger King? Why does he get that name?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
          Jilani Jung Jung Bahadur, the king of Pratibandapuram, is known as the 
Tiger King. At the time of his birth the astrologers declared that the 
prince would have to die one day. The ten-day-old prince asked the 
astrologers to reveal the manner of his death. The wise men were 
baffled at this miracle. The chief astrologer said that his death would 
come from the tiger. The young prince growled and uttered terrifying 
words: 'Let tigers beware!' He decided to kill one hundred tigers. He 
thus got the name 'Tiger King'.

           What did the royal infant grow up to be?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           The royal infant grew up to be the king of Pratibandapuram who was 
obsessed with the idea of killing one hundred tigers. He wanted to do so 
to disprove the prophecy which said that his death would come from the 
hundredth tiger. This made him kill all tigers of Pratibandapuram. He 
even married for the sake of this ambition. He came to be known as the 
Tiger King.

           What will the Maharaja do to find the required number of tigers to 
kill?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           To get the required number of tigers to kill, the Maharaja asked his 
dewan to find a suitable girl for him to marry. A suitable girl for 
matrimonial alliance would be one who would not only come from a 
royal family but also belong to a state with a large tiger population. As 
Pratibandapuram had no more tigers left, a province that belonged to 
his father-in-law would certainly provide him with an opportunity to kill 
more tigers and reach his aim of killing one hundred tigers.

           How will the Maharaja prepare himself for the hundredth tiger which 
was supposed to decide his fate?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           The Maharaja wanted to be extremely careful while dealing with the 
hundredth tiger which was supposed to be the reason for his death. On 
encountering the hundredth one, he took a careful aim at the tiger and 
shot it. When it fell in a crumpled heap, he was overcome with joy and 
left the place hastily.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           What will now happen to the astrologer? Do you think the prophecy 
was indisputably disproved?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           The astrologer dies before the king of Pratibandapuram gets an 
opportunity to kill one hundred tigers. Disproving his prophecy seems to 
be the sole reason for the king's existence. Except for killing hundred 
tigers, everything else takes a back-seat for the king.
The prophecy cannot to be indisputably disproved as the king was 
ultimately killed by a tiger, though neither by a real one nor by the 
hundredth one. Looking at the weak, old and almost lifeless tiger that 
was the hundredth one, no one would have thought that it would 
escape the king’s bullet by fainting at the shock of the bullet whizzing 
past. It was the “tiny little wooden tiger” from the toy shop that caused 
the death of Tiger King.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           The story is a satire on the conceit of those in power. How does the 
author employ the literary device of dramatic irony in the story?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           The story "The Tiger King" is a supreme example of dramatic irony. The 
character acts in a way grossly inappropriate to the actual circumstances 
or expects the opposite of what fate holds in store for him'. Kalki has 
used a very dexterous use of dramatic irony in the story. After killing the 
first tiger the King flaunts its dead body before astrologer to show that 
he is more powerful than the tiger. However, the astrologer warns the 
king that he should be "careful with the hundredth tiger". The king chooses to prove the astrologer wrong once again and makes frantic 
efforts to kill hundred tigers. Thus, having shot at the old tiger, the Tiger 
king believes he has killed the hundredth tiger. But the reader as well as 
the king's officers and minions soon come to know that the emaciated 
tiger does not get killed but only faints. The king gets happy of killing the 
tiger but in actual ignorant of this ironical fate the prediction proves to 
be right and mere sliver on wooden tiger's body causes his dramatic 
death. Quite ironically the hundredth tiger kills the king instead and 
astrologer's predictions stands vindicated.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           What is the author’s indirect comment on subjecting innocent animals 
to the willfulness of human beings?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Through this satirical story the author has rightly portrayed how human 
beings have subjected innocent animals to untold torture and death, 
merely to fulfill their own whims and fancies. The maharaja’s 
indiscriminate killing of tigers led to their extinction in some states, but 
the maharaja was oblivious to the grave consequences his action was 
leading to. In order to prove an astrologer wrong the maharaja went on 
a killing spree proving his dominance over the hapless animals.

      <h3 class="faq-question">
           How would you describe the behaviour of the Maharaja’s minions 
towards him? Do you find them truly sincere towards him or are they 
driven by fear when they obey him? Do we find a similarity in today’s 
political order?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Maharaja’s minions were subservient and sycophantic. Most of them 
were scared of Maharaja and tried to keep him in good humour by 
obeying his orders. They did not dare to disobey him as his displeasure 
could mean loss of their job or even loss of their lives.
The astrologer was afraid of predicting his death , till Maharaja told him 
to “ speak without fear”. Dewan who should have advised the king not 
to kill the tigers did not dare to go against his wishes and aided his 
marriage to a princess whose father’s kingdom possessed a large 
number of tigers. Being afraid of losing his job, he presented an old tiger 
to satisfy the whims of his Maharaja. Likewise , the hunters chose not to 
inform him of the survival of the 100th tiger and instead killed it 
themselves fearing that they might lose their jobs. Even the shopkeeper, 
who sold the king a cheap wooden toy tiger, quoted a higher price lest 
he should be punished under the rules of emergency.
So ,it is evident that the king’s minions were driven by fear rather than 
any feelings of sincerity towards their ruler.
Today’s political order is no different. We know too well that many of 
the people in power are not there because of their ability but because of 
their influence and power. Moreover, others pander to them for their 
own vested interests rather than for the good of the country.

Even the affluent have been involved in instances that illustrate the 
callousness of human beings towards wildlife.
