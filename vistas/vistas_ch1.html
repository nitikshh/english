           What does the third level refer to?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           The third level refers to the subway of the Grand Central Station that 
takes passengers to Galesburg, Illinois. The third level on the station was 
a medium of escape for Charley, the narrator from the harsh realities of 
modern life. It provided him a base where he could interweave fantasy 
and reality.

           Would Charley ever go back to the ticket-counter on the third level to 
buy tickets to Galesburg for himself and his wife?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           No, Charley would never go back to the ticket-counter on the third level 
to buy tickets to Galesburg for himself and his wife because third level 
was his imagination.

           Do you think that the third level was a medium of escape for Charley? 
Why?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Yes, I think that the third level was a medium of escape for Charley. Life 
in modern world is full of insecurity, fear, war, worries and stress. Man 
has to confront them all the times. The harsh realities of life make living 
quite unpleasant and even unbearable. So he wants to escape into a 
wishful world. Charley talks to his psychiatrist friend about the third level 
at the Grand Central Station. His friend calls it “a walking-dream wish 
fulfillment”. Charley possesses an escapist tendency. Even his stamp 
collecting is a ‘temporary refuge from reality’.

           What do you infer from Sam’s letter to Charley?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
         The way Charley came across Sam’s letter was surrounded in mystery. 
Among his oldest first-day covers, he found an envelope. The envelope 
containing the letter bore the address of his grandfather. It was written 
on July 18, 1894. The postmark showed the Picture of President 
Garfield. Generally the first day covers have blank papers in them, but 
this one contained a letter. The letter was addressed to Charley. In the  letter Sam had informed Charley that he was living on the third level. He 
had also told Charley and his wife to keep looking for the third level. 
Clearly, the letter was a product of Charley’s imagination.

           ‘The modern world is full of insecurity, fear, war, worry and stress.’ 
What are the ways in which we attempt to overcome them?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           We can overcome the anxieties and insecurities bred by our inevitable 
existence in the modern world by getting involved in some practical and 
beneficial activities. Cultivating hobbies, spending time with family and 
friends, going on trips and excursions, pursuing meditation and exercises 
help us live a balanced and healthy life. Reading good books is 
equivalent to having good friends with great insight. They not only 
enrich us with the vast store of knowledge but also help us to learn from 
other’s experience and stay rooted to some basic qualities of humanity. 
Joining hobby classes or gym, attending social events like birthdays and 
weddings, going for outdoor games, interacting meaningfully through 
social-networking sites and writing diaries etc can also help us relieve 
our worries and stay focussed and disciplined in life. Simple activities like 
listening to music, playing with pets, an occasional dinner out, watching 
cinema or plays or going to places like parks etc can go a long way in 
helping us get rid of stress, boredom and insecurities.

           Do you see an intersection of time and space in the story?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Yes, there are certain instances in the story that show an intersection of time and space. Firstly, the first two levels of Grand Central Station were 
located in the present time while the third level existed in the 1890s. 
Secondly, Charley and his wife, Louisa, live in the present time yet he 
rushes to get old currency to buy two tickets to go to the Galesburg of 
1894. Further, the old architecture of the platform at the third level is 
different from the modern platforms of the first two levels. Besides, the 
archaic manner of dressing by the people, and the newspaper, The 
World, dated June 11, 1984 also overlaps with Charley’s real time world 
and existence. Lastly, the letter that was mailed to Charley’s grandfather 
on 18th July, 1894 highlights the intersection of time and space as the 
sender (Charley’s friend Sam) and receiver (Charley himself) belong to 
the present time.

           Apparent illogicality sometimes turns out to be a futuristic projection? 
Discuss.
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           It is true that apparent illogicality sometimes turns out to be a futuristic 
projection. Before the Wright Brothers invented the first aeroplane, 
nobody could have dared to believe that man could fly. Before 
Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, it would have been 
impossible to believe in long-distance talks happening in the real-time 
interface. Moreover, there are examples of inventions, like that of 
inventing a modern-day sewing machine with a needle that has hole on 
its wrong end, which were conceived in dreams but now are part of our 
everyday reality.
All this emphasises that fantasies of one point of time that seem illogical 
may turn out to be revolutionary things that change the future of the 
mankind. Similarly, it would not be far-fetched to think about railway stations fitted with time-machine devices that would make travel from 
one era to another just a matter of time.

           Philately helps keep the past alive. Discuss other ways in which this is 
done. What do you think of the human tendency to constantly move 
between the past, the present and the future?
</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
           Besides philately, there are numerous other ways to help keep the past 
alive. Collecting historical artefacts, paintings and inscriptions in a 
museum, collecting and reading books (including autobiographies, bio-
sketches, letters and diary entries) written in different eras, collecting 
and viewing documentaries and other videos are all a few ways of 
revisiting history. Besides, we can keep our culture and traditions alive 
when we follow the rituals in ceremonies, treasure memories in the 
form of videos, photographs and audio collections. Also, reviving old 
monuments, buildings and other artefacts may prove a huge learning 
opportunity to those visiting such places, and promote tourism at the 
same time.
The capacity to oscillate between the past, present and future is a great 
intellectual gift. This human tendency enables him to plan for the future 
in the present by reaping benefits from the past. Consider a very simple 
example of adopting a study technique for board exams. Considering the 
past result (of class test or half yearly exams) a student makes a strategy 
plan to address the weak areas more and score better in the future. 
Thus, such a tendency helps in ensuring acceptance of the impact of 
important decisions taken at any point of time and learning from them.
