          The last lesson is by the author Alphonse Daudet. In the Last Lesson summary, the author narrates events about
          the year 1870 when France was captured by Bismarck led Prussian forces. Furthermore, the Lorraine and Alsace
          districts went under Prussian rule. There was the discontinuation of teaching French in these two districts.
          There was an order for the French teachers to leave. Consequently, M. Hamel was not able to stay in his old
          school. In spite of this, the last lesson from him was full of devotion and sincerity. One student of M. Hamel
          was afraid of him. There was an anticipation of punishment from this student when he came to school that day.
          However, he learnt that this will be his last lesson. Soon, he realized the importance of this subject. This
          story shows us how people feel when they don’t learn their language.
          <br><br>
          The narration of this story is by a French boy, Franz. Franz is a lazy boy. However, in spite of his laziness,
          Franz likes to play and is of a sensitive nature. Furthermore, Franz hates his teacher M. Hamel in his school
          and has no interest in studying French.
          <br><br>
          An order has come from Berlin after taking over the districts of Alsace and Lorraine in France that the German
          language rather than the French should be taught in the schools there. Furthermore, it is the school French
          teacher M. Hamel’s last day. This teacher has been working there for forty years. Moreover, the teacher has
          feelings of patriotism. He is also full of nostalgia and grief. The village men also attend his ‘last lesson’
          so as to honour and respect him. The village is regretting and is sad that they didn’t learn their mother
          tongue in their childhood.
          <br><br>
          Franz receives a big shock when he learns that this is his last lesson in French. He is shocked because he
          does not know French. Furthermore, on learning about the last lesson, a sudden interest arises in him for
          learning French. Moreover, he pays careful attention and learns everything taught on this last day.
          <br><br>
          Instantly, he develops liking for the teacher M. Hamel. His feelings of hatred for him suddenly came to an
          end. Moreover, Franz develops respect for the hard work and sincerity of his teacher. Franz is sad and ashamed
          for being unable to recite his lesson.
          <br><br>
          Hamel explains that they all are at fault for lacking eagerness to learn. Furthermore, he also includes
          himself in this fault. He blames himself for lack of sincerity in teaching them.
          <br><br>
          There is a reflection of his patriotism in his praise for the French language. He says that the French
          language is the most logical and beautiful language in the world. It seems that M. Hamel got emotional on this
          occasion. Furthermore, he asks the class to guard their language. He says that being close to one’s language
          is a way to escape the clutches of slavery. This language will assist them in attaining freedom from the
          Germans. The people realize the significance of their mother tongue. Moreover, they feel the reason for their
          defeat is illiteracy.
          <br><br>
          Franz feels that it is impossible to remove one’s language from a person. This is because it is something that
          is natural to a person. This means that no matter how hard the opposition may try, they will fail to remove
          one’s language.
          <br><br>
          Conclusion of the Last Lesson Summary<br>
          The Last Lesson summary reflects on the importance of one’s language for any race and why it is crucial to
          safeguard it.

          Lost Spring Summary

          ‘Lost Spring’, written by Indian writer Anees Jung, is an excerpt from her book ‘Lost Spring, Stories of
          Stolen Childhood’. In it, she analyses the lives of children living in poverty. This chapter presents stories
          about two children who face poverty in all aspects of their lives and yet have the courage to dream big. The
          writer, Anees Jung, is the narrator in both stories in the chapter.
          <br><br>
          ‘Sometimes I Find a Rupee in the Garbage’
          <br><br>
          The narrator talks about a boy named Saheb. He is a ragpicker whom the narrator sees every morning. She talks
          to him and finds out that he came from Dhaka long back when, according to his mother, his house was swept away
          by storms. That was the reason why his family had come here to earn a living. The narrator asks him to join a
          school, but he replies that there is no school in his neighbourhood. The narrator promises him that she will
          start a school, and he is welcome there. Saheb’s face lights up. A few days later, Saheb comes up to the
          narrator, asking her if her school is ready. The narrator realises that promises like these are made to
          children like Saheb all the time, and they are never kept.
          <br><br>
          The narrator goes on to talk about how children in extreme poverty live and what the conditions surrounding
          them are like. She talks about how children walk barefoot on the streets, and the excuse given for this is
          that it’s a tradition to walk barefoot. She thinks that more than tradition, it might be an excuse to justify
          a continuous state of poverty. She remembers another incident where a man from Udipi told her that he used to
          pray for a pair of shoes at a temple in his childhood. Thirty years later, when the narrator visited the
          temple and the town, she could see a little boy walking in his shoes. Their prayers were answered.
          <br><br>
          To give us a background of Saheb, the narrator talks about Seemapuri – a place near Delhi where the ragpickers
          who came from Bangladesh in 1971 settled down. They have not been given any identities or permits. Only ration
          cards are given to them that help them eat food and vote for politicians. They are deprived of any other
          rights. Over the years, ragpicking has become an art for them. To a child like Saheb, finding a rupee or a ten
          rupee note is a big achievement. One day, she sees Saheb wearing a pair of tennis shoes. One of them had a
          hole in it, and it did not seem to bother him because it was a dream come true for a child who had always
          walked barefoot.
          <br><br>
          Later, the narrator sees Saheb with a steel canister in his hand. She learns that he has started working at a
          tea stall recently and is paid 800 rupees in addition to daily meals. When asked if he was happy with his new
          job, Saheb looked downcast. He was working under someone, and his freedom was taken away from him. He no
          longer had a carefree attitude, and the steel canister seemed heavier than the plastic bag that he used to
          carry for ragpicking.
          <br><br>
          ‘I Want to Drive a Car’
          <br><br>
          This excerpt is about the fate of bangle makers in Firozabad. The author portrays the kind of poverty that
          looms over the houses and streets of bangle makers in this town. Mukesh, a young boy from Firozabad takes the
          narrator to his house, where she discovers the grim conditions under which the people work — around furnaces
          with high temperatures without proper air or light. They do not know that it is illegal for children to be
          working under these kinds of conditions.
          <br><br>
          The narrator observes that bangle-making is done by people belonging to a particular caste specialising in it.
          The art has been passed down from parents to their children for generations. Even after the whole family
          worked at the bangle factory, they remained poor. Mukesh’s family was not able to build a proper house yet.
          The same is the fate of other people living in this area. The sorrow and desperation of being unable to feed
          themselves even three proper meals daily reduced their courage to fight against the situation.
          <br><br>
          When asked why they cannot form a cooperative to improve their living conditions, they said they fear being
          beaten and hauled away by the police for doing something illegal. Their fathers and forefathers were trapped
          by middlemen. The younger generations are still paying the price for that. The bangle makers are downtrodden
          due to the poverty and stigma of their caste. The narrator points out the presence of a vicious circle here:
          The involvement of sahukars, policemen and middleman who do not let these people rise up in society.
          <br><br>
          Therefore no one dares to break away from this line of the profession, from this tragic world of poverty and
          suppression. Mukesh dreams of being a motor mechanic, and the narrator sees a flash of rebellion in his eyes.
          She asked him if he would like to be a pilot someday. Mukesh seemed embarrassed and replied that he was happy
          dreaming about being a motor mechanic. Flying a plane was a dream beyond his reach.
          <br><br>
          Conclusion of Lost Spring
          The lost spring summary shows how we humans create a vicious circle of suppression and torture for our fellow
          human beings that leads to a social and economic imbalance in society. While one class of human beings get to
          enjoy the benefits of human rights and identity, another class of human beings is subjected to fear of
          entrapment and punishment with the wrongful use of socioeconomic politics. The most affected victims of these
          processes are innocent children who miss out on their rights as human beings, when they are employed before
          they come of age or are deprived of basic needs such as education, clothes, shelter and food. These children
          lead to another generation of impoverished and illiterate children — a vicious circle that keeps continuing
          till they are obliged to accept that it’s their fate.

          The Rattrap is a short story written by Selma Lagerlöf about a man who lives a downtrodden life as a vagabond
          and poor rattrap seller. He looks at the world through spectacles of cynicism and misery because of the
          situation in which he finds himself. He thinks of the world as a rat trap, where we are pulled in by the rat
          trap of materialistic things. In the story, he resorts to petty thievery and selling rat traps to sustain
          himself. However, this is not enough, as he still leads an impoverished life. In summary of The Rattrap, it is
          the story of a man who realizes that true happiness is found from the inside, through love, respect and
          appreciation, and not from materialistic things. 
          <br><br>
          The Rattrap Summary Class 12The Rattrap class 12 English lesson begins by introducing the rattrap seller who
          wanders, collecting junk from here and there to put together and turn into functional rat traps. One day, a
          stranger whose cottage door he knocks on allows him to stay the night. The man served the rat trap seller
          porridge with a pipe of tobacco, and they played games. The host explained that he worked at an ironworks
          factory earlier, but now his only source of income was his cow. He showed his guest the thirty kronor he had
          earned the previous month that he hung in a pouch by the window of his cottage.The rat trap seller goes about
          his way when his host leaves in the morning to tend to his cow. However, the rat trap seller returns to steal
          the money in the pouch by breaking the window a little while later. After this, he stumbles through the
          forest, avoiding the highway to be on the safe side, all the while thinking about how he allowed himself to
          fall into the world’s rat trap of materialistic things like money (the thirty kronor he stole). He eventually
          lies down on the ground, which was extremely cold because the story is set in late December. On top of this,
          his clothes were mostly rags, so it was even colder for him. However, as he laid his head down, he heard the
          sound of the iron mill nearby and followed it. When he arrived, people were sitting by the warmth of the
          furnace. No one bothered to object to his being there, so he sat with them.The owner of the mill came by in
          the meantime to do his evening rounds, and upon seeing the tramp, he mistook him for an old comrade, Nils
          Olof. The tramp had a beard and scraggly hair, so it was easy to mistake him for other people. The tramp did
          not deny this, thinking he would get some more money if he went with it. However, when the owner invited him
          to the manor, he declined, out of what the owner thought was an embarrassment. Soon after, the owner’s
          daughter came to attempt to bring the tramp to the house in the name of Christmas Eve, and he had to oblige.At
          the manor, the rat trap seller was given a bath, a haircut, a shave and fresh clothes in the hope that his
          embarrassment coming from his condition would also wash off with his filth. However, when he went into the
          dining room, the ironmaster immediately realized that the tramp was not Nils Olof! He was furious and asked
          the man to leave immediately lest he calls the sheriff. The tramp explained his theory about the world being a
          rat trap, so he was excused. The daughter had her father allow him to stay, and the man looked like he needed
          a hearty meal and some sleep.At the Christmas mass, while the tramp still slept, the family found out about
          the stolen money. On returning to the manor, the rat trap seller had already gone on his way. However, he did
          leave behind a Christmas present for the daughter - the thirty kronor to return to the man in the cottage by
          the roadside, as written by him in a letter with it; Because he was treated with respect, he returned the
          respect.

          Indigo is an excerpt from Louis Fischer’s book – The Life of Mahatma Gandhi. The writer talks about how Gandhi
          dealt with a particular incident regarding indigo sharecroppers in the Champaran district of Bihar. An
          illiterate peasant named Rajkumar Shukla from Champaran goes to Gandhi for help. British landowners were
          ruthlessly exploiting the sharecroppers of this district. It is a minor incident that leads to a prolonged
          fight against the British administration to finally release the suffering peasants from their plight and give
          them the courage to fight for their rights. Indigo Class 12 Summary – a part of CBSE Summary gives us a
          detailed understanding of this chapter. Students can refer to CBSE Notes for further information and study
          materials on this chapter and other topics related to the Class 12 CBSE English syllabus. Students can go to

          <br><br>
          Indigo<br>
          Louis Fischer starts the chapter by recalling his meeting with Mahatma Gandhi at his ashram in Sevagram in
          1942. He remembers Gandhi explaining his urge to initiate the departure of the British from India. It started
          in 1917. He had gone to attend the annual convention of the Indian National Congress Party in Lucknow in
          December 1916. During this event, a farmer named Rajkumar Shukla came up to him, asking for help. He wanted
          Gandhi to help him, and his fellow farmers deal with the injustice imposed upon them by the landlord system in
          Bihar.
          <br><br>
          Rajkumar Shukla followed Gandhi to his ashram until the latter agreed to go to Champaran. It was decided that
          Rajkumar Shukla would take Gandhi to Champaran from Calcutta. After several months, when Gandhi went to
          Calcutta, he found Rajkumar waiting for him at the exact spot at the given time. Rajkumar took Gandhi to the
          house of Rajendra Prasad – a lawyer. The lawyer was not there. So, Gandhi decided to go to Muzaffarpur. He was
          greeted by a professor at the train station – J.B. Kripalani, whom many students accompanied. Although the
          local people were afraid of giving shelter to home-rule supporters like Gandhi, a government school teacher –
          Professor Malkani let him stay for two days at his house.
          <br><br>
          As a number of lawyers and farmers came to meet him, Gandhi understood the problem faced by the farmers. They
          were sharecroppers – tenants that worked on estates owned by British landlords. This system compelled the
          farmers to cultivate fifteen per cent of their land with indigo and hand over the complete harvest to the
          landlords. When the landlords discovered that Germany had developed synthetic indigo, they did not want the
          farmers to grow indigo anymore. So, they asked the farmers to pay some compensatory fees for being released
          from the fifteen per cent arrangement. Some farmers signed willingly, while others hired lawyers to fight
          against this. But when they came to know about the development of synthetic indigo, they wanted their money
          back.
          <br><br>
          Gandhi faced a lot of troubles while approaching the government officials about the Champaran issue. They made
          many excuses and turned him away a number of times. But he stayed put and filed a case with support from
          prominent lawyers and the local farmers. After long meetings with the Lieutenant-Governor, Gandhi was able to
          arrange investigations into the sharecroppers’ issues. A substantial amount of evidence was unearthed, and the
          official enquiry agreed to refund the farmers’ money that was taken from them through illegal and deceitful
          ways.
          <br><br>
          Gandhi asked for fifty per cent of the money while the official enquiry counter-proposed a twenty-five per
          cent refund. Gandhi agreed gladly. To him, the amount of money that was to be paid was less important than the
          fact that British landlords were compelled to surrender their money. Gandhi believed that the landlords were
          surrendering their prestige as well.
          <br><br>
          The outcome of this event was that the fearful and suppressed farmers developed a sense of self-reliance and
          courage to fight for their rights. The writer stresses the fact that Gandhi’s politics was not about being
          loyal to ideals, but it was about being loyal to the people – the human beings involved in it. He took up
          various initiatives to improve the lives of people in Champaran. He started schools along with health and
          sanitation campaigns to help the people of Champaran overcome poverty and misery. His wife, disciples and many
          other people volunteered to help Gandhi bring development to Champaran.
          <br><br>
          Conclusion of Indigo
          Indigo Class 12 summary tells us about the journey of self-reliance and courage during the freedom struggle in
          British India. Gandhi had considered an improvement in the physical and mental conditions of people as a
          crucial factor in the contribution of nationalistic sentiment and resistance by farmers against the British.
          The chapter says that the Champaran incident was considered the first kind of Civil Disobedience victory in
          modern India.

          The Interview starts with the prolog to meet as ordinary reporting since its innovation, which was barely 130
          years prior. As indicated by the creator, it isn't astonishing that individuals have unmistakable sentiments
          about the use of meetings. A meeting has an enduring effect, and as indicated by a well-known adage, when
          discernments are made about someone, in particular, the first character of his spirit gets taken. Acclaimed
          VIPs, scholars, and specialists have been heard censuring interviews. Rudyard Kipling's better half wrote how
          two columnists demolished their day in Boston in her journal. Kipling considers meeting an attack, wrongdoing
          that ought to draw in the discipline. He accepts that a good man could never ask or give a meeting. 
          <br><br>
          The Interview Summary Part I 
          <br><br>
          Meetings are typical nowadays. The individuals who see meets emphatically think of them as a wellspring of
          truth and workmanship. Among the antagonistic perspectives on interviews is the supposition that they are an
          undesirable, unjustifiable, and superfluous interruption and attack into a man's private life; they leave
          individuals injured and destroyed. There are some who have even portrayed meetings as an experience and a
          thumbprint on their windpipe. Yet, in the advanced world, interviews are a remarkably workable vehicle of
          correspondence and help to make impressions of our peers. The questioner holds a ground-breaking position and
          impact. 
          <br><br>
          The Interview Summary Part II
          <br><br>
           It is a passage from a meeting of Prof. Umberto Eco. In his meeting with Mukund Padmanabhan, Umberto
          discusses his inclinations, his style, and the accomplishment of The Name of the Rose. He says that his
          central advantages are philosophical and moral, and these are likewise the prevailing subjects of his
          scholastic work and books. Indeed, even his books for youngsters are about peacefulness and harmony. He says
          that there is a perky and individual quality in his works, which is an embraced one. He found his style when
          he presented his doctoral theory. His theory recounted an account of his examination, his preliminaries, and
          blunders. He, at that point, created his preference for portrayal. Henceforth his scholarly works are not dry
          and exhausting. He explains how he uses even the briefest holes in the middle of two unique bits of errand
          that give others a fallacious impression that he is doing endless things. He calls these holes 'interstices'.
          Working during these interstices makes him do some incredible things.The Name of the Rose was a splendid
          achievement and brought him awesome popularity. Its prosperity might be a direct result of the troublesome
          understanding experience and interpretative perusing that is offered to the peruser who didn't generally look
          for simple understanding encounters. 
          <br><br>
          Conclusion of The InterviewThe exposition is a concentrate from the Introduction to The Penguin Book of
          Interviews. It examines the meeting as a correspondence type that has come to remain. The conclusion of The
          Interview includes the views from the point of journalism and the stars and their insight into the part of
          their lives.

          Going Places summary will help you get a better understanding of the story written by A.R. Barton. It revolves
          around fantasies and daydreams. The story tells us about the teenage period where people are often found
          dreaming which is far from reality. This period is all about desires and achieving the impossible. In
          addition, teens usually have a hero they look up to or adore in this age. However, the main background of the
          story is indeed a reality. It tells us about a girl, Sophie, who belongs to a lower-middle-class family. She
          dreams of owning the best boutique in the whole town. However, she lacks money and means. Sophie looks up to a
          young football player, Danny Casey. She dreams about him so much, she believes she has actually met him.
          Finally, these fantasies are what cause her disappointment.
          <br><br>
          The story begins by telling the reader about a teenage girl, Sophie. Being a normal teenager, she has also got
          many fantasies and dreams. Sophie belongs to a lower-middle-class family that struggles with finances.
          However, she dreams to own a boutique one day. Further, she also dreams of becoming an actress of a fashion
          designer. Similarly, Jansie, her friend, is more practical and level-headed. She knows that they do not have a
          strong financial background, thus they have to work in a biscuit factory. Jansie does not have any
          unachievable fantasies. She tries her best to help Sophie stay in touch with reality, but all that goes in
          vain as Sophie does not listen.
          <br><br>
          Sophie has got two brothers and lives with her parents in a small house. She does not shy away from expressing
          her desires and fantasies. However, her parents do not pay much heed to it as they are far more mature than
          her. They are already facing the harsh realities of life, thus, they do not believe in her fantasies. Sophie’s
          elder brother is Geoff who is tall, strong, and handsome and remains reserved. She is sort of fascinated by
          her elder brother. It is so because his silence makes her jealous and wonders what he keeps thinking about.
          <br><br>
          Further, we learn that Sophie is always fantasizing about a young Irish football player, Danny Casey. She has
          seen him play in a number of matches and thus starts liking him. As she is always living in her fantasy world,
          she makes up stories about him. In one made-up story, she tells her elder brother, Geoff, that they met one
          day in the streets. Being more sensible, Geoff does not believe her story. He feels it is highly unlikely that
          she just met such a sensation in the streets just like that.
          <br><br>
          However, as Sophie is so good at immersing herself in fantasy land, she starts describing life-like details.
          Thus, upon hearing these details, even Geoff wishes that what she was saying turns out to be true. She even
          goes on to say that they will meet again as Danny has promised her. Thus, Sophie immerses herself so much in
          the make-believe story that she starts thinking of it as true. She keeps waiting for Danny to arrives, but
          alas he does not. Thus, on the way back, she is thinking about how Danny’s not turning up will disappoint
          Geoff. Nonetheless, she still keeps fantasizing about him and believes they will definitely meet.
          <br><br>
          Conclusion of Going Places
          To sum up, Going Places summary, we learn about the naïve fantasies of teenagers and how reality may hit us
          harder as the world in full of compromises and costs a lot of dreams.
